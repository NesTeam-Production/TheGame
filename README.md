# The Game

This fun hobby game is the creaton of the minds of *Balázs Faragó*, *Máté Andrasics* and the *Fészek* friendgroup.
There is no clear goal of the game, but to spice up your everyday life with RPG elements and give the oportunity for others to somehow "materialize" some kind of reward for tasks/favors towards **You** as motivation.

## How boring it is really when someone asks you a favor but you don't gain anything from it. Not anymore!

When someone asks You a favor, they can offer You **EXP**(Experience) for it. Now that sounds **more intriguing**, ain't it? 🥇

#### - But what can I do with my EXP?

Well of course You can **level up** and **upgrade** Your character! ⬆️

#### - But why is that good for me?

So You can flex on your friends with your character thats much stronger then theirs! 😉

#### - Okay, flexing is one thing, but I enjoy it more when I can beat them somehow, I have a competitive soul...

We got You! The Game gives you the opportunity to ⚔️Duel⚔️ with your friends! In the Arena, You can show them all how strong Your character really is! 💪
*(thanks to the favors of your friends and the power of friendship of course!)*

#### - Intresting... Okay, I'm still reading so tell me, what options do I have for my character in this game?

*Glad You asked!* 🥳
The game is somewhat based on DnD, sprinkled with basic RPG elements and other ideas of our imagination. So as long as the development continues, there should be countless opportunites! In the meantime, we are all ears for any ideas and suggestions, which you can make under this repository's [*Issues*](https://github.com/Szpoti/TheGame/issues) tab. 
Your character can get stronger on leveling up, but you can acquire Armor🛡️ and Weapons🔪 as well. You can get these through Quests or by trading with other Players as well! 🔃
